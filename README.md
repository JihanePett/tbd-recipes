What is TBD?
TBD is for anyone who likes cooking: 
there is a large range a recipes, the public can read through and try themselves with.
The recipes are not only for regular home chef but also those who count the Thermomix appliance as part of their cooking appliance.
As opposed to other recipe site, where anyone can log in, edit, create, delete their recipes, TBD is a website dedicated to one user only, 
the owner, and is made for the public to enjoy looking at food, recipes and how they are made.
To sum up, anyone looking to spice up and level up their cooking style with or without the Thermomix should be interested in this site. 

UX
As a user, anyone whom enjoy cooking will first have the ability to search through a large range of recipes, those recipes are made for a certain number
of persons and have a preparation time displayed so to get better organised.
The search can either result in a thermomix or other type of recipe. Not restricting the user by selecting either/or will allow him/her to get inspired 
by any recipe instead of being specific unless they request so. In that case, the user is welcomed to use the 'thermomix' or 'other' criteria in their search.

The recipe cards provide a good bit of information to each user as a walkthrough to cook a specific meal. if however, a user is interested to
have it in writing, there is a download button offered to do so.

Apart from browsing each recipes or searching for a specific ingredients, type or category (vegan, gluten-free..), each
user can have a glimpse of what the thermomix offer. After all, the site owner is a thermomix advisor and want to share that experience with as many
potential customers as possible. 
Surfing through the thermomix page, a video welcomes the user, it is the official thermomix video and the owner's word on her own experience
will give a sense of similarity to the user.

Demos were available on site but since COVID19, the owner wants to set up live demos through Zoom which will be discussed in the feature for the future, but so far,
to get ahead and insite the visitors to come back, an agenda has been laid out on that page.

The About gives a good idea of whom the owner is and hope with those amazing characteristics: travel, culture, culinary experience, to be able to promote herself and 
the thermomix to convert traffic into demos lovers and eventually sales.

We are offering 2 ways for any user to contact the owner:
- a chat bubble which provides a sense of uniqueness to a recipe site but above all it brings it to a different level as any culinary or thermomix question can be answered
on the spot.
- a contact form, anyone not having the time to chat can leave a message which will be answered to at a later stage, however, the user gets a nice message letting him know that the owner
recieved his com.

That ends the first part of the site

The second part of the site is dedicated to the Creating, Editing, Deleting, Updating the recipes as well as encompasses the admin chat
It is very important to note at this stage the login holds a 'register' option for the purpose of the MS3 project required by the Code 
Institute, however this option will be delete as soon as the project is scored.






To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
