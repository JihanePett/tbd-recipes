                My name is <strong>Catherine</strong>, traveling is one of my
                passion and it has made me realize I am passionate about people.
                <br />
                I travel and I will keep on traveling not only to discover
                unknown places and amazing landscapes but to live experiences of
                a lifetime and above all to get to know a culture, to talk with
                the people and to discover their way of living.

                This has always put me in a position to remember my smallness,
                to respect people, whoever they are and wherever they come from.
                <br />To a certain extent, it always pushes me to look myself in
                the face, to re-evaluate and readjust myself with who I really
                am because sometimes you get lost in the complexity of things
                and events in life, don't you? There is no trip or country I
                didn’t like; but most of the time, the relationship you get with
                people of a country makes the difference. By their history and
                culture, by their kindness, their character, their charisma...
                people and food is the main reason why I would go back again to
                a country.<br /> Of course, my choice goes first for countries where the human
                contact was rich and these countries are part of the list of
                countries where I have to go back because I remained with a
                taste of not enough. I still have so much to learn from these
                human contacts and exchanges. A lifetime will not be enough.

                Probably, everything around cooking and kitchen provides me with
                similarities and differences with what I have already
                experienced and already known. It seems that this is what brings
                me back to my origins, getting to know myself and what allows me
                to appreciate what I am. <br />I still have so much to learn
                from these culinary exchanges. With hindsight, I have noticed
                that with another culture, another country, other people,
                gastronomy is my point of reference or comparison. <br />Through
                food, I can feel a sense of home and sense of community. Driven
                by a culinary curiosity, an interest in new tastes and original
                shapes my favourite go to place are the local markets and
                places, where i can discover special spices, local vegetables
                and fruits. <br />Whenever I have the opportunity, I sneak in
                local kitchens to furtively check on and learn cooking
                techniques. You understand, I love people, travels and food.
                Like many of us!

                My mother in law actually has the TM21 that was released in
                1996. She always sang the praises of the kitchen appliance. She
                is the one and I thank her for that, who suggested me to have a
                Thermomix.
                <br />Six months after I got my little one, I felt just
                overwhelmed by our new life with a baby, not finding the time to
                cook as before. While I was trying to get on a new routine
                as a new mum, my passion for cooking just faded away, I had no
                interest anymore in cooking or in sharing meals with friends.
                I had no inspiration anymore and if we were not ordering
                ready meals, the basic food I would prepare back then was not
                appealing and flat.
                <br />
                My priorities had changed and I needed to adjust myself to our
                new life. I needed help to save time for myself, get to
                know my little baby, eat properly, make real healthy meals for
                the family, and get ready for when I will be back to my full
                time job!

                It was enough to rely on the ready meals; it was time more than
                ever to take care of our bodies and mind. <br />I found excuses
                to jump as it is an investment and it took a while to decide
                myself buying Thermomix. Initially it “was too much money for a
                simple blender!!!” <br />
                Then “it will take away the joy of food prep and the love of my
                pots and pans”, it will take me away from the kitchen, which is
                my “escape” from the daily worries!
                <br />Out of the three reasons, the last two points were not
                valid anymore as the pots and pans I was praising used to stay
                in the cupboards and trying to organize our healthy and weekly
                meal was stressful and time consuming.
