                My name is Catherine, traveling is one of my passion and it has
                made me realize I am passionate about people. <br />
                I travel and I continue to travel not only to discover unknown
                places and amazing landscapes, to live experiences of a lifetime
                but also and especially to get to know a culture, to talk with
                the people and to discover their culture and their way of
                living.

                This has always put me in a position to remember my smallness,
                to respect people, whoever they are and wherever they come from.
                <br />To a certain extent, it always pushes me to look myself in
                the face, to re-evaluate and readjust myself with who I really
                am because sometimes you get lost in the complexity of things
                and events in life, don't you? There is no trip or country I
                didn’t like; but most of the time, the relationship you get with
                people of a country makes the difference. By their history and
                culture, by their kindness, their character, their charisma...
                people and food is the main reason why I would go back again to
                a country.

                Of course, my choice goes first for countries where the human
                contact was rich and these countries are part of the list of
                countries where I have to go back because I remained with a
                taste of not enough. I still have so much to learn from these
                human contacts and exchanges. A lifetime will not be enough.
                <br />Probably, everything around cooking and kitchen provides
                me with similarities and differences with what I have already
                experienced and already known. It seems that this is what brings
                me back to my origins, getting to know myself and what allows me
                to appreciate what I am. <br />I still have so much to learn
                from these culinary exchanges.

                "I've met many people in Europe. I've even met myself there."
                James Baldwin “J’ai rencontré de nombreuses personnes en Europe.

                With hindsight, I have noticed that with another culture,
                another country, other people, gastronomy is my point of
                reference or comparison.
                <br />Through food, I can feel a sense of home and sense of
                community. Driven by a culinary curiosity, an interest in new
                tastes and original shapes my favourite go to place are the
                local markets and places, where i can discover special spices,
                local vegetables and fruits. <br />Whenever I have the
                opportunity, I sneak in local kitchens to furtively check on and
                learn cooking techniques. You understand, I love people, travels
                and food. Like many of us! <br /><strong

                My mother in law actually has the TM21 that was released in
                1996. She always sang the praises of the kitchen appliance. She
                is the one and I thank her for that, who suggested me to have a
                Thermomix.
                <br />Six months after I got my little one, I felt just
                overwhelmed by our new life with a baby, not finding the time to
                cook as before. <br />While I was trying to get on a new routine
                as a new mum, my passion for cooking just faded away, I had no
                interest anymore in cooking or in sharing meals with friends,
                <br />
                I had no inspiration anymore and if we were not ordering ready
                meals, the basic food I would prepare back then was not
                appealing and flat.
                <br />My priorities had changed and I needed to adjust myself to
                our new life. <br />I needed help to save time for myself, get
                to know my little baby, eat properly, make real healthy meals
                for the family, and get ready for when I will be back to my full
                time job! <br />It was enough to rely on the ready meals; it was
                time more than ever to take care of our bodies and mind. <br />I
                found excuses to jump as it is an investment and it took a while
                to decide myself buying Thermomix. Initially it “was too much
                money for a simple blender!!!” <br />
                Then “it will take away the joy of food prep and the love of my
                pots and pans”, it will take me away from the kitchen, which is
                my “escape” from the daily worries!
                <br />Out of the three reasons, the last two points were not
                valid anymore as the pots and pans I was praising used to stay
                in the cupboards and trying to organize our healthy and weekly
                meal was stressful and time consuming.
