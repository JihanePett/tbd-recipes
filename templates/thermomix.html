            Becoming a Thermomix advisor and being able to earn it or have it
            discounted was sorting out my doubt in putting that much money for a
            “simple blender”.
            <br />Not that we couldn’t afford it, it is the feeling that you
            don’t want to believe it really will help you. You are afraid to be
            disappointed. <br />
            The truth is that the minute an advisor came to my home for a
            demonstration, I knew for sure I had to have one.
            <br />The truth is that the minute I placed Thermomix in my kitchen
            and prepared my first bread and soup in my new kitchen assistant, I
            knew it was the best investment for my time, for our mind and body
            health. <br />The truth is that Thermomix is not a “simple blender”.
            <br />
            Thermomix is one fabulous and versatile cooking machine that can
            replace at least 12 separate other kitchen appliances. So it brought
            me to de -clutter my kitchen and make some space.
