                Becoming a Thermomix advisor and being able to earn it or have
                it discounted was sorting out my doubt in putting that much
                money for a “simple blender”.
                <br />Not that we couldn’t afford it, it is the feeling that you
                don’t want to believe it really will help you. You are afraid to
                be disappointed. <br />
                The truth is that the minute an advisor came to my home for a
                demonstration, I knew for sure I had to have one.
                <br />The truth is that the minute I placed Thermomix in my
                kitchen and prepared my first bread and soup in my new kitchen
                assistant, I knew it was the best investment for my time, for
                our mind and body health. <br />The truth is that Thermomix is
                not a “simple blender”. <br />
                Thermomix is one fabulous and versatile cooking machine that can
                replace at least 12 separate other kitchen appliances. So it
                brought me to de -clutter my kitchen and make some space.
